# How to Save Money: 23 Ways to Start Today

Here’s your crash course on how to start saving money. Like
right now. And listen, even small changes can make a big
difference. So, jump in and take these 23 simple tips to the
bank. Literally.
## Set a savings goal.

Sometimes the best way to save money is by setting a savings
goal—a specific dollar amount with a set deadline. You can try
the 100 Envelope Challenge to hit a $5,050 goal or use our
Savings Tracker and fill in whatever amount you want.

## Set up direct deposits to go into savings.

Set up your direct deposit so some of each paycheck goes
straight to your savings account. That way, you don’t have to
put in a lot of effort to save money—you can just sit back and
watch that savings grow!

## Buy generic.

Hey, I don’t mind if you’re a brand snob about a few things. I
won’t sit up here and tell you that Great Value Twist & Shouts
taste the same as Nabisco Oreos. But please know, a ton of name
brands are exactly the same as the generic—except the name
brand paid more for marketing. And that means you’re paying
more for a fancy logo.

Try out generic brands of staple food items and nonfood
basics, like medicines, cleaning supplies and paper products.

## Stay out of “that store.”

When you’re learning how to save money, don’t even think about
putting yourself in a tempting environment. We all have “that
store”—the one that encourages us to get all spendy and stuff.
For me, it’s Home Goods. For you, it’s (fill in the blank).

Know it. Own it. Avoid it! And then, replace that shopping trip
with something else fun, like baking cookies with the family.
That way, you still enjoy yourself without risking those pricey
purchases.

## Cancel some subscriptions and memberships.

If you want to save money each month, pick one TV
streaming service to cancel. Just one.

Then do a quick audit and see what else you can cut. If that
subscription or membership isn’t changing your life and you’d
rather have that money in your bank account, cancel it.
Remember, most of these cuts are just temporary while you get
that cash stacked.

By the way, it’s easy to find any hidden subscriptions when you
budget with EveryDollar. I’ll tell you more about that in the
final tip on this list!

## Join gas rewards programs.

Some grocery stores offer gas rewards programs. A
discount on gas for buying groceries you have to buy
anyway? Say less. Just make sure you’re not signing up for any
rewards programs linked to a credit card. You’re trying to save
money—not go into debt, okay?

## Meal plan.

The hardest budget line to keep in line? Food. The best way to
save money on food? Meal plan. (Every breakfast, lunch,
dinner and even snack!)

Build your meal plan based on:
  * What’s already in the fridge, freezer and pantry (don’t
 waste food!)
  * Your schedule (need quick dinners for busy nights?)
  * What’s on sale (pick recipes with ingredients that are on
 sale)
  * Recipes with fewer ingredients (less is more here—more
 savings, that is)

Then make a grocery list—and stick to it. For real. Say goodbye
to wasted food and drive-thru temptations and hello to legit
money savings.

By the way, you can download my girl Rachel Cruze’s free
Meal Planner & Grocery Savings Guide for more tips, tricks and
even printables to help you here.

## Use cash-back apps and coupons.

Use coupons. You can clip them from actual paper or click them
in an app, but this is money just waiting to be saved. Don’t
sleep on it.

Then go one step further and check out [184]cash-back apps to
save even more on stuff you’re already going to buy. (Just
don’t get talked into buying things you don’t need because of a
deal—that’s not a deal. At all.)

## Get a library card.

Before you click Add to Cart on that brand-new book, get
yourself a library card. And if you’re more into audiobooks or
e-books, download an app like Libby that connects to your
library so you can check out those versions on your phone or
tablet.

## Pack your lunch.

Get this—the average household spends about $3,639 on
food outside of the home each year.^[185]1 That’s $303 a month!
And you know some of that is spent going out for lunch during
the workday. Learn some [186]cheap lunch ideas and pack your
midday meal instead—it’s a great way to save money and eat
healthier.

## Stop eating out.

Are y’all ready for me to level up that last challenge? What if
you stopped eating out completely? I know, I’m trying your life
right now. But look—it’s not for forever. It’s just for a
season. You could pack that $303 into your savings each
month and hit your goals way quicker.

Also, if you’re in debt, this is the first luxury I need you to
cut. And you won’t even have to skip out on your favorites. You
know you can make more—and better—pizza at the house for way
less anyway.

## Switch your cell phone plan.

When was the last time you shopped around for better cell
phone deals? It’s time.

See what other providers offer. Then take what you learn to
your provider and see if they’ll give you a deal to stick with
them. If not, and you aren’t in a contract with a time frame,
go ahead and make that switch.

## Skip the coffee shop.

This one gets said so much some of you are rolling your
eyes—but if you’ve got a big coffee shop habit, you can save
big by becoming your own barista. And when you do go out for a
treat, learn some [189]coffee shop hacks so you aren’t paying
full price for your fancy caffeine fix.

## Use the cash envelope system (aka cash stuffing).

Step away from the plastic. In fact, go ahead and take the
credit and debit cards out of your wallet. If you really want
to get serious about saving, start using the cash envelope
system to practice mindful spending.

When you use cash, it activates the pain centers of your brain,
creating more friction for every purchase. Simply put,
when you spend cash, you feel it. And that helps you spend
less—which means you save more.

## Reduce energy costs.

If you’re looking for easy ways to save money on your
electric bill, make a few tweaks at home.

Start with some simple things, like taking shorter showers
(notice I didn’t say fewer showers), fixing that toilet that
runs continuously, washing your clothes in cold water, and
turning the lights off when you leave a room. You’ll be shocked
at how these small changes can really add up.

## DIY . . . everything!

Before you shell out the cash to pay for a new backsplash,
bench or fancy light fixture, think about doing it yourself.
Usually, the cost of materials and a simple YouTube search will
save you a ton of money here.

I’ll be honest—your girl is not crafty in any way, shape or
form, so I’ll probably just wait until I can afford to pay a
pro. But if projects are your thing, check out this list
of 10 home projects you can probably tackle yourself.

## Carpool.

Okay, I know the idea of carpooling might make your skin crawl,
but if you’ve got some trustworthy coworkers who live close to
you, you can save a lot of gas money—and wear and tear on your
car—by taking turns driving each other to work.

## Try a no-spend month.

Let’s be honest: If you’re in the midst of trying to pay off
debt or save money, every month should be a no-spend
month. Keeping a needs-based, no-fluff budget for 30 days at a
time can save hundreds if not thousands for some!

Because that’s what a no-spend month is—you commit to cutting
out those nonessentials for one month.

Just make sure you know your parameters from day one (what you
will and won’t buy). And do yourself a favor: Get an
accountability partner or have a friend take the challenge with
you. It seriously helps.

## Adjust your tax withholdings.

Listen, if you’re getting huge tax refunds each year, that
means you’ve been loaning the government money every month
without interest. I don’t think so—homey don’t play that. It’s
time to adjust your tax withholdings. Put that money back
into your monthly budget.

## Check your insurance rates.

Why is this a money-saving tip? You could be overpaying or be
underinsured. Both of those can cost you big. This isn’t an
excuse to cut insurances, but it is an excuse to take our
Coverage Checkup to make sure you’ve got the exact
coverage you need.

## Learn the power of no (or not now).

We live in a world of instant gratification. Food from our
favorite restaurants— boom! At our door in an hour or less. The
show you want to binge—ready for you to hit play now. The ads
on social media say you need this, that, and the other. And
with the swipe of your finger, it’s at your doorstep. We’re
just a couple clicks away from nearly instantly satisfying our
desires for anything.

But if you’ll delay some of that gratification by using the
magic of no—or in some cases, not now—you’ll save so much
money, build better spending habits, and feel more contentment
overall. Savings with a side of mental and emotional health?
Yes, please.

## Say goodbye to debt.

I’m not the only one who says ditching your debt is a top
tip for saving money. But even if I was, I’d still shout it
from the rooftops, because I’ve lived this.

My husband and I paid off $460,000 in debt. (You read that
right.) And getting that weight off our backs and out of our
lives meant first deciding to stop borrowing money. Because
borrowed money, aka debt, straight up steals your income.

I mean, look at how much money debt is taking from the average
American each month:
  * Average student loan payment: $393
  * Average credit card payment (based on a 2% minimum
 payment): $116.10
  * Average new car payment: $726
  * Total: $1,235.10

Imagine throwing $1,235.10 toward your savings goals instead of
toward your past. Every month.

And that's just three kinds of debt and some national averages
there. Now look at your debt. What would you get back in the
budget if it was gone? Paying off debt takes time and
effort—but keep your eye on how much you’ll save and the
freedom you’ll feel when you finally get to pay yourself
instead of paying debt.

## Make a budget.

A budget is just a plan for your money. Think of it as a map to
get you to your money goals. And you need a budget.

Because here’s the thing—if you follow every single one of
these tips on how to save money but you don’t have a budget . .
. you’re playing yourself. You’ll end up accidentally spending
everything you intentionally saved. Simply because you didn’t
have a plan!

We’ve all been there, so let’s level up.

I need you to make a budget today to see where you are
with your money—and then keep making one every single month to
get where you want to be.

Whether you budget already or not, check out EveryDollar.
This is the budgeting app my family uses. EveryDollar played a
huge role in helping us get out of debt, and it helps us set
and stick to our money goals.

And remember those hidden expenses and subscriptions I talked
about earlier? Well, guess what: They can’t hide when you
budget. Set up automatic transactions so your expenses stream
straight into EveryDollar. You’ll just drag and drop them
into the right budget line. Then you’ll clearly see all your
spending and can decide to cut anything you don’t need or use!
That’s a huge money-saving tip right there.

You can do this! Starting today, you can save more and spend
less by using these 23 tips.
