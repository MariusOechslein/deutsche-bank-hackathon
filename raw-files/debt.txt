# Debt Management Plans: Everything You Need to Know
A debt management plan is a tailored strategy to help you repay
outstanding debt and financial obligations without using a new
loan. Typically, [157]credit counseling agencies work with
creditors on your behalf to determine a debt management plan
that fits your financial circumstances. Here’s how debt
management plans work and how to decide if one is right for
you.

## Key Takeaways

* Debt management plans are structured repayment plans to
help you repay outstanding debt.
* In most cases, credit counseling agencies negotiate payment
plans on your behalf.
* It also involves you restructuring your budget to pay off
old debt, manage your current finances, and find other ways
to become financially secure.

## Pros and Cons of a Debt Management Plan
A debt management plan can help reduce your debt and strengthen
your finances, but it’s not for everyone. This strategy has
both upsides and downsides to keep in mind when determining if
it’s right for you.
### Pros
* Structured repayment plan
* Pay off debt sooner
* Potentially lower interest rates or save on fees
### Cons
* No new credit allowed
* Takes time to complete
* Not all debt is included

## Pros Explained
* Structured repayment plan: You’ll receive a tailored plan
that takes into account your specific financial situation,
ensuring you'll be making payments you can afford. That
way, you can get your finances on track.
* Pay off debt sooner: With a new payment plan, you can pay
off your debt sooner than if you were to only make minimum
payments or pay when you could. This can help improve your
credit score as well as save you money on the total
interest you pay.
* Potentially lower interest rates or save on fees: When your
credit counselor crafts your plan, they may negotiate
the terms of your debt. That includes working on your
behalf to lower interest rates, get charges removed, or
have fees waived. This helps in reducing the total amount
you owe to your creditors.

## Cons Explained
* No new credit allowed: Most debt management plans have a
 requirement that you don’t open new [161]lines of credit or
 loans while repaying your debt. So if you want to take out
 a car loan or mortgage, you may not be able to under a debt
 management plan.
* Takes time to complete: While you could pay your debt off
 sooner than you would without a plan, it could still take
 time to pay off all your debt in full. This may hold you
 back from other financial goals, like buying a home or
 making another large purchase.
* Not all debt is included: While some of your creditors may
 agree to your plan, not all of them will—nor are they
 required to. This means while you might have a structured
 plan for some of your outstanding debt, it may not include
 all of it. For instance, credit card debt may be included,
 but home or auto loans may have to be paid separately.

## How Debt Management Plans Work

Credit counseling agencies review your finances and then help
you negotiate and potentially reduce your outstanding debt.
You’ll make one monthly payment to the agency, and then they
will pay your creditors. Generally, you will have to pay an
initial and monthly fee.

With a debt management plan, it can take a few years until all
your outstanding debt is paid in full. You usually won’t be
able to open new lines of credit or take out new loans,
including credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages while under
the plan. In some cases, you may have to close your accounts.

## Eligibility for a Debt Management Plan

Not all debt is eligible for a debt management plan. Often,
only unsecured debt, such as personal loans or credit card
debt, is eligible for a debt management plan. Other types of
debt, like a mortgage or auto loan that are backed by
collateral, may not qualify.

## Creating and Implementing a Debt Management Plan

Not all credit counseling agencies are accredited and
trustworthy. If a company is promising quick results and
requires an upfront payment, look elsewhere. You can often find
a nonprofit credit counseling agency through your bank or local
consumer protection agency. A good counselor will spend
significant time reviewing your personal situation and offer
you several options.

Here are the main steps to take to establish a debt management
plan with a reputable credit counseling agency:
1. Check eligibility: Consult with a credit counseling agency
to see if you’re a good fit for a debt management plan. A
credit counselor will review your financial situation to
see if you can qualify. Even if a debt management plan
isn’t the right fit for you, a credit counselor should help
you find other debt relief options and offer you
educational resources.
2. Create a debt management plan: Your counselor will craft a
plan that fits your finances. You’ll make one payment every
month to the credit counseling agency, which will
distribute it to all of your outstanding creditors. That
amount may include an administrative fee for your
counselor. Read over your agreement to make sure it
actually suits your needs before you agree to anything.
3. Put your plan to work: Your agency will contact creditors
and lenders on your behalf and negotiate outstanding fees
or charges to try to lower the total amount you owe. While
not all creditors are required to agree with the
negotiations, your credit counseling agency will work on
compromises.
4. Pause or cancel credit obligations: You’ll likely have to
close any credit cards that are in your debt management
plan. You may also have limited access to opening up new
lines of credit or loans.
5. Make your payments: You’ll make monthly payments as
required. It could take a few years to repay all of your
outstanding debt, depending on the size of your debt and
payments.

## Is a Debt Management Plan Right for You?

You might want to get a debt management plan if:
  * You have a lot of outstanding unsecured debt, like credit
 card debt.
  * You’re carrying a lot of debt with high interest or fees.
  * You are making minimum payments, but your debt is not
 decreasing due to interest.
  * You have trouble making minimum payments on your
 outstanding debt each month.

You may want to look into other types of debt relief if:
  * You have secured debt or other types of debt that wouldn’t
 qualify for a debt management plan.
  * You have some credit card debt but can afford the minimum
 payments every month.
  * You want to make a large purchase within the next few
 years, like a home or car.
  * You aren’t ready to stop using credit cards.

## Alternatives to Debt Management Plans

While debt management plans can offer significant help with
reducing your debt, they are not necessarily the best solution
for everyone. Consider some alternatives as you work on your
debt repayment strategy.

### Debt Consolidation

If you have many different types of outstanding debt, like
credit cards and secured loans, you may want to try [165]debt
consolidation.

Debt consolidation is when you take out a loan to pay off your
outstanding debt and then make payments on your new loan. This
may be helpful if you know how much to borrow as a lump
sum and can get a lower interest rate than what you’re
paying right now on your outstanding debt.

If you have credit card debt, you may want to look into 0%
annual percentage rate (APR) balance transfer credit
cards. With a balance transfer, you move over funds from one
credit card (or more) onto a card that has a promotional 0% APR
for a set amount of months, such as 12 or 24 months. With no
interest growing on your balance, you can pay off your credit
card faster because your full payment will go toward your
principal. You’ll also save more in total interest.

If your new credit card or loan limit won’t cover all your
outstanding debt, you’ll have to repay both your new card and
any remaining amount that didn’t transfer over

## Bankruptcy

If your debt is too much to handle, you may want to explore
bankruptcy. While bankruptcy won’t wipe out all your debt
obligations, it could help get it restructured and set up a
repayment plan.

There are a few different options for bankruptcy, including
Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Chapter 7 is liquidation,
where all your assets are liquidated to pay off your
outstanding debt. Some other debts may be wiped out completely.
Chapter 13 reorganizes your debt, but you’ll get to keep your
assets, such as your home, in the process.

Chapter 7 can take a few months to get through, whereas Chapter
13 could take a few years to finish. A bankruptcy can stay on
your credit report for seven–10 years, depending on the
option you choose.

## What Are the Benefits of a Debt Management Plan?

Debt management plans can help you implement a strategy to
repay a large amount of debt. You’ll receive tailored advice
and support for your financial circumstances. Your interest
rate may also be reduced or fees may be waived to help lessen
the total amount you owe.

## Will a Debt Management Plan Hurt My Credit?

A debt management plan can hurt your credit in a few different
ways. You might be required to close some credit cards while
you’re in a debt management plan. Closing accounts can lessen
your total credit history and your total credit
utilization, which causes your score to drop.

## What Are the Alternatives to Debt Management Plans?

Rather than getting a debt management plan, you can look into
alternatives like a debt consolidation loan, a balance transfer
credit card, or even bankruptcy. If none of those are viable
options for you, look into setting up your own debt repayment
plans, using strategies like the debt avalanche or
debt snowball. Or, you could take a do-it-yourself
approach by negotiating with your creditors directly, instead
of using a credit counseling agency.

## The Bottom Line

A debt management plan can provide substantial debt relief to
many people without the need for a new loan, but it’s not
necessarily the best option for everyone. The best method for
reducing your debt load will depend on a number of factors,
including your income, amount of debt, and credit score. Weigh
the pros and cons of all your options for paying off debt,
perhaps with the help of a financial advisor, before you
determine which one is best for you.
