# The 50/30/20 rule: how to budget your money more efficiently
 
Budgeting doesn’t need to be complicated, nor should it take hours out of your day. In fact, the best ways to budget are often the simplest. Take, for example, the 50/30/20 rule. The 50/30/20 rule is a straightforward monthly budgeting method that tells you exactly how much to put towards your savings and your living costs each month.
With a clear big-picture overview of your budget for the month, you can confidently avoid overspending and build up your
savings over time—all without painstakingly recording every
single transaction.
 
So, if you’ve ever downloaded a budgeting app only to abandon
it by the third day, you might want to give the 50/30/20 method
a try. It’s one of the best budgeting tips we’ve found, and
here’s how it works.
 
 
 
## What is the 50/30/20 rule?
 
The 50/30/20 rule is an easy budgeting method that can help you
to manage your money effectively, simply and sustainably. The
basic rule of thumb is to divide your monthly after-tax income
into three spending categories: 50% for needs, 30% for wants and 20% for savings or paying off debt.
 
By regularly keeping your expenses balanced across these main
spending areas, you can put your money to work more
efficiently. And with only three major categories to track, you
can save yourself the time and stress of digging into the
details every time you spend.
 
However, the 50/30/20 rule should only be used as a rule of thumb for budget planning. The exact percentages for each category depend on your personal financial situation, local cost of living, inflation, and many other factors.
 
One question we hear a lot when it comes to budgeting is, “Why
can’t I save more?” The 50/30/20 rule is a great way to solve
that age-old riddle and build more structure into your spending
habits. It can make it easier to reach your financial goals,
whether you’re saving up for a rainy day or working to pay off
debt.
 
## Where did the 50/30/20 rule come from?
 
The 50/30/20 rule originates from the 2005 book, “All Your
Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan,” written by current US
Senator Elizabeth Warren and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi.
 
Referencing over 20 years of research, Warren and Tyagi
conclude that you don’t need a complicated budget to get your
finances in check. All you need to do is balance your money
across your needs, wants and savings goals by using the
50/30/20 rule.
 
## How to budget your money with the 50/30/20 rule
 
The 50/30/20 rule simplifies budgeting by dividing your
after-tax income into just three spending categories: needs,
wants and savings or debts.
 
Knowing exactly how much to spend on each category will make it
easier to stick to your budget, and help keep your spending in
check. Here’s what a budget that adheres to the 50/30/20 rule
looks like:
 
### Spend 50% of your money on needs
 
Simply put, needs are expenses that you can’t avoid—payments
for all the essentials that would be difficult to live without.
50% of your after-tax income should cover your most necessary
costs.
 
Needs may include:
  * Monthly rent
  * Electricity and gas bills
  * Transportation
  * Insurances (for healthcare, car, or pets)
  * Minimum loan repayments
  * Basic groceries
 
For example, if your monthly after-tax income is €2000, €1000
should be allocated to your needs.
 
This budget may differ from one person to another. If you find
that your needs add up to much more than 50% of your take-home
income, you may be able to make some changes to bring those
expenses down a bit. This could be as simple as swapping to
a different energy provider, or finding some new ways to
save money while grocery shopping. It could also mean
deeper life changes, such as looking for a less-expensive
living situation.
 
### Spend 30% of your money on wants
 
With 50% of your after-tax income taking care of your most
basic needs, 30% of your after-tax income can be used to cover
your wants. Wants are defined as non-essential expenses—things
that you choose to spend your money on, although you could live
without them if you had to.
 
These may include:
  * Dining out
  * Clothes shopping
  * Holidays
  * Gym membership
  * Entertainment subscriptions (Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime)
  * Groceries (other than the essentials)
 
Using the same example as above, if your monthly after-tax
income is €2000, you can spend €600 for your wants. And if you
discover that you’re spending too much on your wants, it’s
worth thinking about which of those you could cut back on.
 
As a side note, following the 50/30/20 rule doesn’t mean not
being able to enjoy your life. It simply means being more
conscious about your money by finding areas in your budget
where you’re needlessly overspending. If you’re confused about
whether something is a need or a want, simply ask yourself,
“Could I live without this?” If the answer is yes, that’s
probably a want.
 
### Stash 20% of your money for savings
 
With 50% of your monthly income going towards your needs and
30% allocated to your wants, the remaining 20% can be put
towards achieving your savings goals, or paying back any
outstanding debts. Although minimum repayments are considered
needs, any extra repayments reduce your existing debt and
future interest, so they are classified as savings.
 
Consistently putting aside 20% of your pay each month can help
you build a better, more durable savings plan. This is true
whether your ultimate goal is building an emergency fund,
developing a long-term personal financial plan, or even
preparing for a down payment on a house.
 
And it’s impressive how quickly the savings can add up. If you
bring home €2000 after tax each month, you could put €400
towards your savings goals. In just a year, you’ll have saved
close to €5000!
 
## How to apply the 50/30/20 rule: a step-by-step guide
 
So, how do you actually use the 50/30/20 rule? To put this
simple budgeting rule into action, you’ll have to calculate the
50/30/20 ratio based on your income and categorize your
spending. Here’s how:
 
### 1. Calculate your after-tax income
 
The first step to using the 50/30/20 budgeting rule is to
calculate your after-tax income. If you’re a freelancer, your
after-tax income will be what you earn in a month, minus your
business expenses and the amount you’ve set aside for taxes.
 
If you’re an employee with a steady paycheck, this will be
easier. Take a look at your payslip to see how much lands in
your bank account each month. If your paycheck automatically
deducts payments such as health insurance or pension funds, add
them back in.
 
### 2. Categorize your spending for the past month
 
To get a true picture of where your money goes each month,
you’ll need to see how and where you’ve spent your income over
the past month. Grab a copy of your bank statement for the past
30 days, or simply use the Insights feature in your N26
app. It automatically sorts all your transactions into
categories such as Salary, Food & Groceries, Leisure &
Entertainment, and more.
 
 
Now, split all your expenses into the three categories: needs,
wants and savings. Remember, a need is an essential expense
that you can’t live without, such as rent. A want is an
additional luxury that you could live without, such as dining
out. And savings are additional debt repayments, retirement
contributions to your pension fund, or money that you’re saving
for a rainy day.
 
### 3. Evaluate and adjust your spending to match the 50/30/20 rule
 
Now that you can see how much of your money goes towards your
needs, wants and savings each month, you can start to adjust
your budget to match the 50/30/20 rule. The best way to do this
is to assess how much you spend on your wants every month.
 
According to the 50/30/20 rule, a want is not extravagant—it’s
a basic nicety that allows you to enjoy life. As cutting back
on your needs can be a complex and challenging task, it’s best
to work out which of your wants you can cut back on to stay
within 30% of your take-home income. The more you reduce
spending on your wants, the more likely it is that you’ll be
able to hit your 20% savings target.
