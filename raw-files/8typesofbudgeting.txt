# Eight types of budgeting processes and the pros and cons of
each.


## Budgeting is a critical component of financial planning and one of
the cornerstones of any successful business strategy. Budgets arm
decision-makers with a robust foundation of fiscal insights, enabling
leaders to make informed choices, whether it is about launching a new
product, entering a new market, or making crucial operational
changes.

By offering a tangible financial roadmap, budgeting facilitates
proactive management, anticipating challenges and seizing
opportunities. But is more than just allocating resources; it’s
a strategic tool that, when used effectively, can propel a
business to new heights.

With various budgeting methods available, how can an
organisation determine the most appropriate one for its unique
needs?

Here’s an overview of the 8 major budgeting types, the pros and
cons of each as well as when to consider each method:

### 1. Traditional/Incremental Budgeting: A method that builds on
the previous period’s budget (usually by adding incremental
changes) to set the new budget. Its predictability is its
strength.

  * Pros:

 1. Familiar and straightforward. It’s a tried and tested
 process.
 2. Builds upon previous years’ budgets, making it relatively
 easy to prepare.

  * Cons:

 1. Can perpetuate inefficiencies from past budgets.
 2. May not adapt well to rapidly changing business or market
 environments.

When to Consider: If the business environment is stable, and
the company prefers a tried-and-tested method.

### 2. Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB): A budgeting process where every
expense must be justified for each new period, starting from a
“zero base”. In this budget, every penny counts.

  * Pros:

 1. Encourages scrutiny of all expenses, potentially revealing
 inefficiencies.
 2. Aligns spending with organisational objectives.

  * Cons:

 1. Time-consuming and resource intensive.
 2. Can be difficult to implement, especially in larger
 organisations.

When to Consider: When an organisation is looking for a
comprehensive financial review or is in a phase of
restructuring.

### 3. Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB): A method that budgets based
on the cost of activities required to produce a product or
service, or with operational outputs.
  * Pros:

 1. Helps in strategic resource allocation and prioritisation.
 2. Can provide a granular view of resource allocation.

  * Cons:

 1. Can be complex and time-consuming, which can deter its
 adoption.
 2. Requires detailed analysis and understanding of processes
 and activities.

When to Consider: Useful for businesses keen on aligning their
financial plans with operational activities or deliverables.

### 4. Value Proposition Budgeting: Budgeting that prioritises
spending based on the expected return on investment (ROI) and
value generation for the business.
  * Pros:

 1. Focuses on activities that add value to the business.
 2. Prioritises spending based on the high return on investment
 activities.

  * Cons:

 1. Determining “value” can be subjective.
 2. Might overlook necessary functions that don’t have
 immediate, tangible ROI.

When to Consider: For businesses looking to align budgeting
closely with strategic objectives and value generation.

### 5. Rolling Forecasts (Continuous Budgeting): A dynamic or fluid
budgeting approach that continuously updates by adding new
periods (e.g., months or quarters) as the most recent period is
completed.
  * Pros:

 1. Offers more flexibility as well as strategic alignment.
 2. Allows businesses to rapidly adapt to changing conditions.

  * Cons:

 1. Requires regular updates, which can be resource intensive.
 2. Might lead to short-term thinking.

When to Consider: In rapidly changing business environments
where a fixed, annual budget might quickly become obsolete.

### 6. Project-Based Budgeting: Budgeting tailored to specific
projects, detailing the income and expenses expected for each
project. This approach is excellent for businesses running
multiple projects simultaneously.

  * Pros:

 1. Ensures project-specific financial alignment.
 2. Helps in allocating resources to individual projects
 effectively.

  * Cons:

 1. Not a holistic approach for the entire organisation.
 2. Needs constant updates as project requirements change.

When to Consider: For businesses involved in numerous distinct
projects, like construction firms or project-based tech
companies.

### 7. Participatory Budgeting (or Bottom-Up Budgeting): A
budgeting process where individual departments or teams
contribute to the budget’s development. This approach promotes
consensus across the business.
  * Pros:

 1. Engages different departments/teams, leading to more and
 diverse insights.
 2. Increases ownership and commitment to the budget.

  * Cons:

 1. Can be a prolonged, time-consuming process.
 2. Risks of inflated budget requests.

When to Consider: When you want to boost internal engagement in
the budgeting process and tap into the insights of different
employees.

### 8. Flexible Budgeting: A budget that adjusts based on actual
levels of activity during a period, allowing for comparison
with the budgeted performance.
  * Pros:

 1. Adjusts based on actual operational levels and provides
 real-time financial clarity.
 2. Helps in a direct comparison of actual vs. budgeted
 performance.

  * Cons:

 1. Requires more sophisticated financial systems.
 2. Might be more complex to prepare initially.

When to Consider: For industries with varying operational
levels or periodic demand changes, like seasonal businesses

By understanding different budgeting methods, businesses can
pick or combine approaches that align seamlessly with their
objectives, ensuring not just fiscal discretion but also
strategic clarity.

## Five hybrid budgeting approaches to consider.

As business conditions and strategies evolve, leaders may also
reassess and adapt their budgeting methods to stay aligned with
their objectives. The combination approach aims to leverage the
strengths of multiple methods while mitigating their respective
weaknesses. Some budgeting approaches naturally complement each
other.

Five examples of hybrid approaches to consider:

### 1. Traditional/Incremental with Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB):

A hybrid approach could involve applying ZBB at specific
intervals (e.g., every few years) while using incremental
adjustments in the interim. This combines the thoroughness of
ZBB with the efficiency of traditional budgeting.

### 2. Rolling Forecasts with Traditional/Incremental Budgeting:

Companies might use traditional budgeting for the start of the
year but employ rolling forecasts to adjust projections as the
year progresses and new data becomes available.

### 3. Participatory Budgeting with ZBB or ABB:

Engaging various departments in the budgeting process
(Participatory) can be combined with either ZBB or ABB. This
ensures that while every expense is justified (ZBB) or
activities are evaluated (ABB), the insights and needs of
individual departments are also considered.

### 4. Flexible Budgeting with Rolling Forecasts:

A flexible budget adjusts for variances in activity levels,
while rolling forecasts continually update. Combining the two
can offer a dynamic and adaptive budgeting model that reflects
actual business performance and evolving projections.

### 5. Project-Based Budgeting with ZBB or Rolling Forecasts:

For companies involved in multiple projects, they might apply
ZBB for each new project to justify all costs. Alternatively,
for long-term projects, rolling forecasts can be used to update
the budget based on the project’s progress and changing
conditions.

The decision to combine budgeting methods should be driven by a
company’s strategic objectives, operational intricacies, and
the challenges they face in their budgeting process. By
blending approaches, businesses can create a tailored budgeting
system that aligns with their unique environment and goals.
