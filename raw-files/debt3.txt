## Assess your debt load

To a large extent, the best way to get out of debt will depend
on how much you owe compared with your income.

Start by understanding whether you simply have too much
debt. That gives you an idea of whether you can use a DIY
strategy for payoff or should consider debt relief options.

The calculator below compares the amount you owe on key debt
types, and compares it to your gross annual income (total pay
before taxes or deductions).
## Weigh DIY payoff methods

### Debt snowball: With this strategy for getting out of debt,
you focus on paying off your smallest balance first. Put all
the extra money you can dedicate to debt payoff toward that
account while continuing to pay the minimums on the others.

When that debt is wiped out, add the amount you'd been paying
on it to the minimum payment on the next largest debt. The
amount you’re paying on the focus debt keeps growing like a
snowball getting larger as you roll it.

### Debt avalanche: Focus on the debt with the highest
interest rate first (while paying minimums on the others), then
the next highest rate and so on.

This might save you money over the long run by wiping out the
costliest debt first. But depending on the balance, it might
take a while to zero out that first debt. If quicker wins would
motivate you, snowball may be a better method.

### Focus on high credit utilization: You could also focus on
paying down your credit cards with the highest [524]credit
utilization — the highest percentage of the credit limit being
used. Credit utilization plays a big role in your credit score,
so in this case paying down debt could have a side benefit of
helping your score.

## Consider debt consolidation to get out of debt faster

Debt consolidation takes your high-interest debt, like
credit card balances, and rolls them into one monthly payment,
ideally at a lower interest rate. Some potential benefits of
consolidating your debt include:
  * Lowering your interest rate.
  * Making your payments more manageable.
  * Shortening the time it takes to pay off your debt.

You might be able to use a balance transfer credit card or
a debt consolidation loan, but note that you’ll likely
need a good credit score to qualify. Each lender sets its own
requirements, but generally scores of 690 or higher count as
good credit scores.

It’s also possible to borrow from your 401(k) or to
consider using some of your home equity to pay debt — but
be aware that you risk your retirement savings and your home in
those cases.
## Boost debt payoff with budgeting

If you feel like you don’t have enough money to cut down debt,
getting clear on your budget may help. And keeping track
of the money you have coming and going is always a good idea,
no matter your financial goals.

### Choose a system that works for you: There’s no
one-size-fits-all budgeting system, and budgeting can be
harder for some people than others. For example, being
neurodiverse can come with unique financial challenges. But the
good news is that there are several ways to budget, and you can
find the way that works for you, like the zero-based approach,
the envelope system or the 50/30/20 budget.

### Use technology to make things easier: Technology can make
budgeting easier by letting you keep track of all of your
financial accounts, categorize your expenses and automate your
payments. There are also several budget apps to help you
stay on top of your money.
## Lower your bills

Finding ways to reduce your monthly bills can help to free up
more money to put toward debt payoff. And every little bit
counts. Don’t be afraid to contact your service providers and
see if you can negotiate a better rate on expenses like your
cell phone bill or energy bill.

You may also be able to negotiate your bills for things
like your car insurance, credit cards, gym memberships and
cable service. Switching providers might get you a better deal.
Do your research to compare the rates of different companies,
be firm and don’t forget to make follow-up calls if needed.
## Make more money

If you have the ability, making more money even in the
short term can boost your debt repayment plan.

Consider getting a part-time job, selling gently used or unused
items or using your skills to do freelance work. A side hustle
like house sitting, driving for Uber or Lyft or even dog
walking can fuel your progress.

Don’t rule out the possibility of increasing your current
salary. Research and preparation may help you [539]negotiate
more money at your current job.

## Don’t be afraid of debt relief

If you’ve tried budgeting, negotiating your payments and
bringing in more cash, all to no avail, you might want to try
debt relief. [540]Debt relief can help you change the amount or
the terms of your debt to lighten your financial burden, but
it’s not for everyone.

You should also explore debt relief if paying off your
unsecured debt like credit card bills, personal loans and
medical debt within five years isn’t feasible or if your total
amount of unsecured debt equals 50% or more of your gross
income.

### Debt management typically involves working with an
accredited counseling agency to pay off your debt at reduced
interest rates or with waived fees.

### Bankruptcy — Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 are the two most
common forms — involves either erasing most unsecured debt or
being placed on a court-approved repayment plan for three to
five years.

### Debt settlement might suit people who don’t qualify for
bankruptcy or who simply don’t want to file for it. You can try
settling debt on your own by contacting creditors or you can
hire a company to do it for you.
